# Summer Research 2022
Python scripts, SQL commands, and Entity-relationship diagrams I developed as part of a paid Summer Research program I was a part of in Westminster College in between June and July of 2022. Repository also includes spreadsheet files that were imported into the SQL server.

NOTE: This project was done with a group and only the Westminster University Summer Research Program provided funding for the project.

`int_flights_erd.png` and `int_flights_rs.png` are based on international departure flight data [3] [4]. `time_spent_erd.png` and `time_spent_rs.png` are based on international time spent data [1] [2].
