'''A simple Python application to display a list of all episodes of a TV series.
This program is complicated by the fact that the class database server is behind a firewall and we are not allowed to
connect directly to the MySQL server running on it. As a workaround, we set up an ssh tunnel (this is the purpose
of the DatabaseTunnel class) and then connect through that. In a more normal database application setting (in
particular if you are writing a database app that connects to a server running on the same computer) you would not
have to bother with the tunnel and could just connect directly.'''
